* Ontario Tech Thesis Template
This is the thesis template I modified from [[http://faculty.uoit.ca/macmillan/thesis_template.zip][Joe's undergradutate template]].

** How to use this template

Copy the necessary files into the same directory as your thesis.
The template is then loaded with =\documentclass{Ontario_Tech_Thesis}=.

** Optional Arguments

There are four options that can be passed to the class (as well as other arguments for the book class)
- =oneside= Creates a one sided document instead of the default two
- =nocoat= Removes the coat of arms on the title page
- =BW= Uses a black coat of arms and black for the chapter titles
- =phd= Modifies Thesis Examination Information to include the additional committee member

Furthermore, if your university is not UOIT, within the =.tex= you can specify your institution by uncommenting the line =%\university{Your University}=.
