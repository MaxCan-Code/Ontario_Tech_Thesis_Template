* Parameters
Change the following variables in [[./run_demo.py]] to adjust your meshes,
each is a list containing the following elements:
- ~initial_cells_lst~ :: number of initial cells in the mesh
- ~R_lst~ :: radius of the mesh (not used)
- ~refn_lst~ :: number of refinements made to the mesh

* Running with Apptainer
** Installing Apptainer
The installation section on
https://apptainer.org/docs/admin/1.0/installation.html
wasn't very helpful.
Install with the package manager on your system

** Building the Container
The Apptainer webinar on
https://helpwiki.sharcnet.ca/wiki/Online_Seminars
recommends building containers on local hard drive[fn::
Page 13 of
https://helpwiki.sharcnet.ca/wiki/images/e/eb/Apptainer.pdf]

To build the container[fn:1]:
#+begin_src sh
  apptainer build -f --fix-perms FEniCS-pandas.{sif,def}
#+end_src
If the ~-f~ flag gives you a permission denied error,
try building with ~sudo~.
See the error message from ~apptainer build~ for more info

[fn:1] After building the container,
you can get the above command by running
~apptainer run-help FEniCS-pandas.sif~

** Running Locally
After saving your changes in [[./run_demo.py]],
run and get the resource usage with:
#+begin_src sh
  command time -v apptainer run -C -B ~ FEniCS-pandas.sif \
	  python3 $(pwd)/run_demo.py
  less ~/out.csv
#+end_src
The result will be written to =~/out.csv=

* Running on Cluster
** Transfer the Container to Cluster
I recommend ~rsync~:
#+begin_src sh
  rsync -rltuP \
	FEniCS-pandas.sif \
	mpich_job.sh \
	run_demo.py \
	demo_singular_poisson.py \
	someuser@gra-dtn1.computecanada.ca:projects/def-professor/FEniCS-job
#+end_src
See https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Transferring_data#Rsync for more
(The ~?~ icon beside the commands links to useful explanations)

** Submit Job
After saving your changes in [[./run_demo.py]],
submit the Slurm job with
~sbatch mpich_job.sh~[fn::
See
https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Running_jobs
for more on Slurm jobs]
